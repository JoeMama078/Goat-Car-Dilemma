So here is how the game works
1. There are 3 doors, one has a car, the other two have goats; obviously you want the car
2. You pick one at random
3. The host reveals a different door that has a goat behind it
4. You can choose to switch your choice to a different door; will you?

So  basically the dilemma is whether or not to switch the door on step 4
Some say it doesn't matter but others say always switch it because the probability is in your favor
This code  proves that you should always switch!
